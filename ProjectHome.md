# GSerializer javascript Serialization Library #

## Introduction ##
GSerializer is a javascript library to serialize/deserialize javascript objects to and from strings, for persistance in say, a Cookie. Unlike many other implementations, GSerializer can also serialize functions and non-JSON notation.

## Goal ##
The aim of this project is to create a library that is:
  * Easy to use
  * Lightweight
  * Compatible with other JS libraries
  * Compatible across systems/browsers
  * Secure
  * Compatible with other languages

## PHP Serialization Design ##
I am currently taking suggestions, ideas and comments on features for the PHP Serialization implementation of GSerializer. Please add your comments on the PHPFeature Wiki.
