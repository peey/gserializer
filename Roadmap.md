# Roadmap #

Currently, GSerializer is a stand-alone library with no dependencies on any other library - I would like to keep it this way.

## Feature Wish list ##

  * Serialization format options (i.e. XML, PHP style serialized strings etc.)
  * Enhanced security protection
  * Compatibility with PHP simple objects
